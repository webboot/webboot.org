### canary notice:

#### we have never shared any data about our users with anyone.

**if this page disappears, it means that the rule above has been broken by force.**

### data that might get compromised:

#### debug logs

some debugging data will be logged, for a maximum of 7 days.
this data will never include any ip addresses, or other identifying data.

#### pgp keystore metadata

all email addresses and names of the gpg keys imported into the @webboot gpg keystore.
this is built into gpg.

that's it, since we do not save any other data about you, there is nothing else to steal.
