## validate code

you are a person who knows some code, but you do not really want to write some now?

head over to our
[github repositories](https://github.com/webboot/)
and read through the code, see if you spot something.

soon, @webboot and [codechain](https://github.com/frankbraun/codechain/)
will allow us to create a chain of review proofs for the web.

on top of that, we will implement login/registration and social networking features
for validation over the next few months.

do you have that cryptocurrency wallet you want to empty
because you always worry about losing the private key anyways?

that wad of cash in your mattress is uncomfortable when sleeping?
